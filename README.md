# Dynamic Project: Public Transport and inequality in the U.S 


## Project overview

This project uses dynamic visualizations to illustrate the relationship between public transportation services and inequality.

Public transportation services in cities are important in many ways. Access to just about everything associated with upward mobility and jobs, quality food, and goods, healthcare, and schooling relies on the ability to get around in an efficient way, and for an affordable price. 

While people of all income levels use public transit, some people depend on it more than others. These riders are often lower-income, minority groups who may not own cars and who rely on transit for access to opportunities like jobs and schools.
