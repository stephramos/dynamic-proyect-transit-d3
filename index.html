        <h4 class="intro__dek">By Stephanie Ramos</h4>
        <p class="intro__p"> Public transportation services in citiesare important in many ways. Access to just about 
          everything associated with upward mobility and jobs, quality foor, and goods, healthcare, 
          and schooling relies on the ability to get around in an efficient way, and for an affordable
          price. </p>
          <p>U.S public transportation lags behind much of the rest of the world in innovation and ridership.
          While some cities do have impressive public transportation systems, for the most part the U.S is 
          a car-dependent society. <p>
          <p>The 2019 Census data showed that only 5% of all US commuters typically  use public transportation. In major cities,
          that number increases to 10%. This trend has not changed over the last  10 years.</p>
          <p>While people of all income levels use public transit, some people depend on it more than others. These
          riders are often lower-income, minority groups who may not own cars and who rely on transitfor Access
          to opportunities like jobs and schools.</p>

            <h4>Counties with  popular public transit systems are often northern and coastal</h4>
            <p>The New York area has the largest  percentage of people who use public transit
             to commute to work, followed by counties including major coastal cities like San Fancisco, D.C, 
             and Boston. </p>
             <p>Public transportation is less popular in counties including major southern cities.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="step" data-step="2">
            <h4>Riding transit takes much loger than driving</h4>
            <p>Those taking transportation in areas where service is limited are bound to be in for longer commutes.
              In counties including major southern cities like Charlotte and Atlanta, the typical transit commute length is
              double the commute length for drivers. But, counties including major coastal cities with robust transit still show numbers that
              lag well behind driving.</p>
            <p>Note that in areas were public transit is popular, the additional commute lenght for public transit users
            is shorter.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="step" data-step="3">
            <h4>Public transit commuters earn less than drivers</h4>
            <p>There is a gap in earnings between public transit commuters and drivers, suggesting that public transportation is 
            less available in wealthier areas or people choose to avoid it if they can affor a vehicle.</p>
            <p>Given that the difference in earnings is larger in areas with low transit use, the lack of an adequate public transportation
            system affects the low-income population disproportionately.</p>
